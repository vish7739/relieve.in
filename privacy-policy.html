                    <p>Relievy Automation ('we", 'us", 'our') provides automated data processing tools specifically designed to assist finance teams, audit professionals, and related practitioners in streamlining manual workflows. Our solutions convert PDF documents into well-formatted Excel sheets, merge multiple Excel sheets or workbooks, and perform similar transformations on structured and unstructured financial data.</p>
                    <p>We recognize that the information processed through our tools often includes highly sensitive financial records-such as bank statements, Form 26AS tax statements, ledgers and other workbooks containing transactional or personally identifiable financial information. This Policy establishes our binding commitment to the complete privacy, confidentiality, and secure deletion of all such data.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-0">This Policy applies to all tools, web applications, and related services offered under the Relievy Automation brand. It governs the collection, use, retention, and deletion of any data uploaded or generated through our services.</p>

                    </ul>
                    <p>We do not request, encourage, or require the upload of unnecessary personal information (such as government-issued identifiers beyond what is already contained in financial documents, health data, or biometric information). Users remain solely responsible for the content they choose to upload.</p>

                     <h6 class="text-dark mb-3 mt-2">3.2 Information Collected During User Interaction</h6>
                    <p>When Users contact us for technical support, feature requests, or general inquiries, we may collect:</p>

                    <h4 class="text-dark mb-3">5. Legal Basis for Processing</h4>
                    <p>As Relievv Automation operates prior to formal incorporation, we process your Data based on your explicit consent. By uploading Data and initiating a Job, you affirmatively consent to the temporary processing, storage, and deletion practices described in this Policy. You may withdraw your consent at any time by ceasing use of our tools. Withdrawal does not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.</p>

                    <h4 class="text-dark mb-3">6. Data Retention and Permanent Deletion</h4>
                    <p>We have engineered our infrastructure to minimize the lifespan of your Data. All Data uploaded to our tools is subject to mandatory, automated, and permanent deletion according to the following rules.</p>
                    
                    <h6 class="text-dark mb-3 mt-2">6.1 Immediate AutoDelete (Tools with Full Automation)</h6>
                    <p>A subset of our tools is already equipped with instantaneous autodelete functionality. For these tools:</p>
                    <ul class="position-relative dot-inside-vl">
                        <li>Data resides only in volatile memory (RAM) during the active processing window.</li>
                        <li>The instant the processed output is delivered to the User, the Data is permanently erased from all memory and storage media.</li>
                        <li>No copy is ever written to disk, and no backup or residual artifact is created.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h6 class="text-dark mb-3 mt-2">6.2 Standard 24–48 Hour Deletion (All Other Tools)</h6>
                    <p>For tools that do not yet support immediate autodelete, the following strict retention policy applies:</p>
                    <ul class="position-relative dot-inside-vl">
                        <li>Data is temporarily stored in secure, accesscontrolled storage.</li>
                        <li>Within 24 to 48 hours after the Job is completed, the Data is automatically and permanently deleted from all systems, including any redundant copies, caches, or temporary directories.</li>
                        <li>This deletion is performed by hardened, automated routines and does not require any manual intervention.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h6 class="text-dark mb-3 mt-2">6.3 No Retention Beyond Stated Periods</h6>
                    <p>We do not retain any backup copies of Useruploaded Data. Once the applicable retention window expires, the Data is irrecoverably destroyed. No human operator can restore or access it after deletion.</p>

                    <h6 class="text-dark mb-3 mt-2">6.4 Ongoing Enhancement Roadmap</h6>
                    <p>We are actively migrating all remaining tools to the immediate autodelete model. Our goal is to eliminate any persistent storage of User Data, regardless of duration. We anticipate completing this transition within the coming months and will update this Policy as each tool is upgraded.</p>

                    <h4 class="text-dark mb-3">7. Data Sharing and Third-Party Disclosure</h4>
                    <p><strong class="text-dark">7.1</strong> Our personnel do not access User Data except in the rare event of a critical system failure requiring debugging, and only with your explicit, prior authorization.

                    <p><strong class="text-dark">7.2</strong> In the event we receive a legally binding request for disclosure (e.g., a valid subpoena or court order), we will make commercially reasonable efforts to notify you in advance unless prohibited by law.

                    <p>We employ a defenseindepth approach to protect your Data against unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction. While we continuously strengthen our security posture, we believe in full transparency regarding both current capabilities and areas under active development.</p>
                    
                    <h6 class="text-dark mb-3 mt-2">8.1 Current Security Measures</h6>
                    <ul class="position-relative dot-inside-vl">
                        <li><strong class="text-dark">Access Controls:</strong> Strict rolebased access controls (RBAC) limit system access to a minimal set of authorized personnel. All access is authenticated, authorized, and logged.</li>
                        <li><strong class="text-dark">Physical Security:</strong> Our servers are housed in tier3 / tier4 data centers with 24/7 onsite security, biometric access controls, video surveillance, and redundant power/environmental controls.</li>
                        <li><strong class="text-dark">Network Security:</strong> Enterprisegrade firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS), and regular vulnerability assessments are deployed to defend against external threats.</li>
                        <li><strong class="text-dark">Operational Security:</strong> All systems are hardened in accordance with industry best practices. Security patches are applied promptly.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h6 class="text-dark mb-3 mt-2">8.2 Encryption (In Development)</h6>
                    <p><strong class="text-dark">8.2.1 Current Status</strong> Data is not currently encrypted either during transmission (in transit) or while stored (at rest). This is a temporary condition that we are actively remediating.</p>
                    <p><strong class="text-dark">8.2.2 Planned Implementation</strong> We are developing and testing comprehensive encryption protocols, which will include:</p>
                    <ul class="position-relative dot-inside-vl">
                        <li><strong class="text-dark">Encryption in Transit:</strong> Full TLS 1.3 (or higher) for all communications between User browsers and our servers.</li>
                        <li><strong class="text-dark">Encryption at Rest:</strong> Encryption for all stored Data, with keys managed in a secure, isolated key management infrastructure.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We expect to deploy productionready encryption across all tools in the near future. Upon successful implementation, this Policy will be immediately updated, and all Users will benefit from endtoend encryption.</p>

                    <h6 class="text-dark mb-3 mt-2">8.3 User Guidance Pending Encryption</h6>
                    <p>Until encryption is fully deployed, we strongly advise against uploading Data that is subject to heightened regulatory or contractual confidentiality requirements. This includes, but is not limited to:</p>
                    <ul class="position-relative dot-inside-vl">
                        <li>Unredacted bank account numbers;</li>
                        <li>Personal identification numbers (e.g., Social Security numbers, Aadhaar, PAN);</li>
                        <li>Protected health information;</li>
                        <li>Trade secrets or competitively sensitive business strategies.</li>
                    </ul>

                        <li><strong class="text-dark">Right to Erasure:</strong> You may request immediate deletion of any Data you believe is still stored. Our standard retention policy already achieves this, but we will honor any expedited request.</li>
                        <li><strong class="text-dark">Right to Withdraw Consent:</strong> You may withdraw your consent to processing at any time by discontinuing use of our tools. Any Jobs already in progress will be completed and then deleted per Section 6.</li>
